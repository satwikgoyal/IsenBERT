# IsenBERT
This repo is for a course project for CompSci 520. 

We plan to use Reinforcement Learning algorithms for OpenAI gym's Mountain Car. 

We will also apply Software Engineering strategies and techniques. We will apply Template Method design pattern as well as code review OpenAI gym's documentation

Algorithms.py contains the main algorithms used ultilizing Template Method

Mountain_Car.ipynb is the main notebook where all algorithms can be run as well as the Mountain Car game
