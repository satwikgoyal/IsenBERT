# About this Repository
- This repo is for a course project for CompSci 520, 
- We have used 4 Reinforcement Learning algorithms for OpenAI gym's Mountain Car,
- We have applied Software Engineering strategies and techniques. We have used the Template Method design pattern and have code reviewed OpenAI gym's documentation,
- The Algorithms directory contains the Template for all algorithms as well as the code for all algorithms,
  - Algorithms.py contains the Template Class for the Template Method,
  - Actor_Critic.py, DQN.py, sarsa_lambda.py, and true_online_sarsa_lambda.py contain the specialization classes for each of those algorithms,
- Mountain_Car.ipynb is the main notebook where all algorithms can be run as well as the Mountain Car game,
- The Notebooks directory contains the first drafts of code we wrote and ran on Jupyter Notebooks.
